# Asset Risk Analysis using CAPM

This project involves developing a simple Python model to analyze asset risk using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The model calculates beta, expected return, and risk-adjusted performance through linear regression and market data.

## Features

- **CAPM Calculations**: Calculates beta, expected return, and risk-adjusted performance.
- **Integration with yfinance**: Fetches stock data using yfinance.
- **Log Returns**: Applies log returns to the stock data.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes CAPM insights to support quantitative analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization.
